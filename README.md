# Brazilian-E-Commerce

Use case begins when user selects a product category or state from a drop-down menu
Selected state becomes filter in SQL queries
Business rule: state must exist in database & state must have orders associated with it
Selected product becomes the parameter for the GET_STATES function, which generates the state where that product sells the most
Business rule: product category must have more than 1 order in a given state.
Website generates two tables and three KPIs, corresponding to the following:
Top 10 product categories as defined by number of products sold: This gets generated by the query “Top 10 product categories in a state”
Average product price by product category
KPI: % of customer orders shipped to seller’s state
KPI: average number of months for a business to reach max orders
KPI: population growth percentage
